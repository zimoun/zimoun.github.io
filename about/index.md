[^1]: right, Google is evil, but the storage and the search features are really useful. So, I am thinking to switch to [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org), but not enough time to configure it, yet.

About this site
===============

The site is mainly written in [Markdown][] with GNU Emacs,
then [Jekyll][] generates the static webpages.

The nice point is: once Jekyll configured,
the building from Mardown is automatic after each commit to GitHub.
It is in the spirit of (La)Tex:
the content and the style are separated,
and I worried once about the style,
and now, I am just writting human readable files.
However, I am thinking to switch from Markdown to [Org][].
