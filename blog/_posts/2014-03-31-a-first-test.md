I start to write something.
But problems with Maths still occur... oh no!!
I write another stuffs, just to see what happens now.  
The double space are not great at all to break the line. But whatever !

$$ a = 1 $$

$ b = 2 $

super

$$ 
\int x 
$$

\[ h(x) = \Delta s^2 \]


Well, this is the first try to test.
$ 1/x^{2} $
mouais craps
\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \]

\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\end{equation}
